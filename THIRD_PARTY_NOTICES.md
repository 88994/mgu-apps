## Equalizer DSP

The new biquad implementation uses the mathematical peaking-EQ formulae
documented in the W3C Audio EQ Cookbook by Robert Bristow-Johnson:
https://www.w3.org/TR/audio-eq-cookbook/. The filter, service and streaming
client are new repository code; no Moonride, BMW DSP binary or firmware audio
code is redistributed. Existing MGU App Kit runtime assets retain their
previous notices.
